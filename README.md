# Features

## Match Making
- Queuing System
  - chessU makes use of in-memory data structure to store queues of different modes
  - upon players queuing up for a match, chessU will push the player into the appropraite queue and when another player of the appropriate elo appears in the queue they will be matched up.

- Match confirm
  - when a match is made between two players, chessU will prompt a confirmation for both of the players involved.
  - only when both players accept the match before the count down running out the players will be loaded into the game
  - other wise players will return to the game option selection form
  - the timer starts with 15 seconds initially

## Invitation
- invitation feature is only available for casual mode
- players can enter a username and send an invite to a friend
- invitation can only be sent to users that are registered as friends on the platform
- when a proper username is entered, the sender will wait for the opponent to accept, similar to match confirm

!["sending invite"](https://github.com/tmslee/chessU/blob/main/server/screenshots/invite_send.png)

- if the friend is currently in queue or in the middle of accepting a match the invitation will not be sent and the following will display for the sender

!["invite failed"](https://github.com/tmslee/chessU/blob/main/server/screenshots/invite_failed.png)

- the invitation recipient will be prompted to accept or decline the invitation as a pop up toast at the bottom right corner of their page
